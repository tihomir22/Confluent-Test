## Interview Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to look for a candidate that is able to:

- Take this [mock](./mock.png) and turn it into a production-ready application
- Experience with building a React application
- Write clean and reusable code

You can start the project by:
1. Installing dependencies
2. Then run `npm start`

Once ready, please take a look at [App.js](./src/App.js) file.

Happy Coding!

### Success Criteria

We should be able to see full cast of Each movie by clicking the arrow on the right. User should only be able to see one details at a time. Being able to provide additional functionality to have multiple movies expanded is a plus.

__UI__

We are not looking for results that are pixel-perfect. Use your own judgement in terms of spacing, font sizes, etc.

__Assets__

We are using a custom-built icon in this mock, you can find it under `src/video.svg`

__CSS or SCSS__

SCSS and SCSS modules come with this repo for free. So if you'd like to use scss or scss modules from your components you can do something like `import css from '/path/to/css'`

__Submission__

You will have 2 days to complete this task. Once finished, remove the node_modules folder, zip your project, and send it to your recruiter.

__Questions__

If you have any questions please feel free to email hartanto@confluent.io and/or dshafie@confluent.io

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
